#ADVENT


##What is this?
It's a game similar to Dwarf Fortress, but without fortress'. The main story isn't finished yet; however, I released this now so that people could get a feel for creating maps for the game.

##Creating a map
A map (example.txt, example.ch, example.desc) is included in the Maps folder. Everything about creating a map is in that file.

##The game's story
So about two months ago, my friend and I were brainstorming ideas for games to make. Me, being in the mood for an ascii-type game, suggested the idea of a game similar to Dwarf Fortress. He said that it would be too easy, so I suggested we code it all in VBScript. <b>Yeah</b>. Two months later, here I am with the 'engine' of the game.
It loads maps from a .ch, .desk, and .txt file. The .ch is to state entities in the map (Triggers, enemies, etc.), the .desc is read as a message box to the player when they input the command 'look', and the .txt is the actual map layout.
he game does have an in-game updater, but you can disable it. When you first open advent.vbs, it will create a .cfg file. Check out the stuff in there.
